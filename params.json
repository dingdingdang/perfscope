{"name":"Perfscope","tagline":"A tool that statically evaluates source code commit's risk of introducing performance regression","body":"This is the source tree for PerfScope, a neat tool for analyzing \r\ngiven patch's performance impact to existing source repository. \r\n\r\nPerfScope is a research project from the [Opera Research Group](\r\nhttp://opera.ucsd.edu) in University of California, San Diego. It \r\nconsists of several parts to operate:\r\n\r\n- Parser: parses the patch file for information like what file(s) \r\n    are modified, which location does it lie, etc.\r\n    Located: \r\n      -- lib/parser/PatchCompiler, Debug+Asserts/bin/patch-c\r\n      -- lib/parser/PatchIRDecoder, library\r\n\r\n- Mapper: maps the change location in source file to the \r\n    corresponding programming constructs.\r\n    Located: \r\n      -- lib/mapper, library\r\n\r\n- Filter: prunes out insignificant changes such as stylish changes \r\n    or renaming. \r\n    Located: \r\n      -- tools/PerfDiff, Debug+Asserts/bin/perfdiff\r\n\r\n- Profile Database: contains a list of frequent or expensive functions. \r\n    White-list functions can also be added to the profile.\r\n    Located: \r\n      -- data\r\n\r\n- Analyzer: performs Performance Risk Analysis (PRA) on given commit.\r\n    Located:\r\n      -- tools/PerfScope, Debug+Asserts/bin/perfscope\r\n\r\n- TestDB: tracks performance test cases execution information to \r\n    further recommend which test case may be useful to uncover the \r\n    performance regression issues. (work in progress)\r\n\r\nTwo auxiliary tools:\r\n- ListFiles: list the file names and paths in a given module.\r\n    Located:\r\n      -- tools/ListFiles, Debug+Asserts/lib/LLVMListFiles.so\r\n- StaticProfiler: generate a list of expensive and frequent functions based\r\n    on static analysis.\r\n    Located:\r\n      -- tools/StaticProfiler, Debug+Asserts/bin/staticprofiler\r\n\r\nMost of the tools have a separate README in their location and its\r\nusages can be found using -h option.\r\n\r\nFor bug report or any other suggestion, please contact ryanhuang@cs.ucsd.edu.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
